* Class: CMSC140 CRN 30384
* Instructor: Professor Justh
* Project 3
* Description: write a program that calculates the occupancy rate
 and the total hotel income for one night and displays this
 information as well as some other information described below.
* Due Date: 04/02/2023
* I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
 I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
