/* Class: CMSC140 CRN 30384
* Instructor: Professor Justh
* Project #1
* Description: Project 1 program. A program that greets the user and offers the user two number games to a patriciate, in. One of the game users gives a number to the program, and the program tells the user that number in years, sounds, days, months, etc. Next, the game user gives the number, and the program adds and divides in, int, and floats with the user-given number.
* Due Date: Sunday, February 19, 2023 at 11:59pm
* I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment
independently.
 I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
 I have not given my code to any student.
